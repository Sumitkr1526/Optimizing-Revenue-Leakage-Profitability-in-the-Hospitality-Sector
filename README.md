# Optimizing Revenue Leakage & Profitability in the Hospitality Sector

This project analyzes hotel booking, room utilization, and revenue data to identify where revenue is being lost and how overall profitability can be improved.

The focus is on understanding occupancy patterns, booking platform performance, room category efficiency, and operational costs. Using data analysis and visualization, the project highlights key revenue leakage points such as underperforming premium rooms, high cancellation rates on certain platforms, and fixed operational costs that do not match demand.

# What this project covers

Analysis of booking data, occupancy rates, RevPAR, and realized vs generated revenue

Comparison of booking platforms to evaluate revenue contribution, cancellation impact, and ROI

Room category performance analysis to identify high-cost, low-yield room types

Cost optimization through dynamic housekeeping staffing based on demand

Business-focused recommendations backed by data and ROI calculations

# Key insights

Premium room types had very low occupancy but high maintenance costs, hurting profitability

Certain third-party platforms showed high cancellations and poor return compared to direct bookings

Fixed staffing led to unnecessary monthly expenses during low-demand periods

Repurposing underutilized assets (like premium rooms) showed strong revenue potential

# Tools & skills used

SQL for data analysis and KPI calculations

Power BI for dashboards and visual storytelling

Business analysis and root cause analysis

Revenue optimization and cost-efficiency modeling

This project demonstrates how data-driven decisions can uncover hidden revenue leakage and turn operational inefficiencies into measurable business gains
